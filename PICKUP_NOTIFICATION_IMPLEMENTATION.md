# Self-Pickup Notification System Implementation üöóüì±

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive self-pickup notification system that allows post authors to receive notifications when customers place pickup orders, view complete order details, verify pickup codes, and complete pickup transactions.

## ‚ú® NEW: Pickup Code Synchronization Fix
**FIXED**: The pickup code discrepancy between customer display and backend verification has been resolved!

### What was the issue?
- **Customer Interface**: Was generating random 4-digit codes instead of using actual pickup codes
- **Backend**: Was generating and storing actual pickup codes with expiration times
- **Result**: Mismatch between what customers saw (e.g., "3443") and what staff needed to verify (e.g., "3321")

### The Fix Applied:
1. **Updated PickupSuccessScreen.jsx**: Now uses actual pickup code from order data instead of generating random codes
2. **Updated CartPage.jsx**: Now includes `pickupCode` and `pickupCodeExpiresAt` from backend response in order data
3. **Enhanced Expiration Handling**: Timer now uses actual expiration time from backend instead of fixed 20 minutes
4. **Improved Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track pickup code sources and debug future issues
5. **Removed Debug Code**: Cleaned up temporary debugging components

### Technical Details:
```javascript
// Before (CartPage.jsx)
const pickupOrderData = {
  orderId: response.order._id,
  total: total,
  // ... other fields but missing pickup code
};

// After (CartPage.jsx) 
const pickupOrderData = {
  orderId: response.order._id,
  total: total,
  // ... other fields
  pickupCode: response.order.pickupCode,           // ‚úÖ Now included
  pickupCodeExpiresAt: response.order.pickupCodeExpiresAt  // ‚úÖ Now included
};
```

```javascript
// Before (PickupSuccessScreen.jsx)
const generateOTP = () => {
  return Math.floor(1000 + Math.random() * 9000).toString();  // ‚ùå Random
};
setOtp(generateOTP());

// After (PickupSuccessScreen.jsx)
if (orderData?.pickupCode) {
  setOtp(orderData.pickupCode);  // ‚úÖ Uses actual backend code
} else {
  // Fallback for demo/testing only
}
```

## ‚ú® NEW: Full Order Details Integration

- **Complete Customer Information**: Name, contact details
